Send them all a link to view this repo. Pick a student and invite them to the group repo as a collaborator, and thave them clone the project.

Have all the other students fork and then clone it, then add a js file with a console.log of their name.

Have your student collaborator add their name to the index.html file.

Show how you don't have the student collaborator's changes yet, and pull them down. Show how that works.

To demonstrate conflicts, have the SC add another change at the same time as you added yours. Have them push up first, and show what happens (conflict errors) when you try to push up on the same branch.

To resolve these conflicts, make a new branch. Make a pull request and show how to resolve the conflicts in GitHub and merge it in.

For the students who forked and cloned, make sure they've added and pushed their changes. Explain that in an open source project you'll need to fork and clone the repos.

Have them create a new pull request to add their repo to your base repo. Then show you merging the pull requests in and how it updates the original repo. Now you can see and pull down the changes made by them in their forked repos. Note that forking does not create a new branch but rather a separate repo.
